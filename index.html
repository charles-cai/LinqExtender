LinqExtender is a toolkit for building custom LINQ providers. It provides an abstracted layer over the original IQyeryable and IQueryProvider implementation and provides a simplified syntax tree. Moreover, it covers things like projection , method calls , ordery by , member parsing, etc internally. Therefore developer can focus more on his main task minus the complexity.
